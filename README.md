# A Rusty Snake Clone

This is a minimalistic clone of the game snake that I made to get a feel for the
rust programming language.


### Roadmap

The game is functionally complete (snake's not that complicated), but there are
some QOL features that would be nice to implement eventually:

- ~A buffer to queue up inputs.~ (implemented)
- Rendering that scales with the window size.
- Optional walls and difficulty scaling.
    - set both in-game and through arguments.
- Main menu, game over, and settings screens.
